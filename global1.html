        <h3>Why a Balanced Diet Matters</h3>
        <p>
            A good diet is essential to maintain good health and well-being. In fact, a healthy diet ensures that your body gets the vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates it needs to function optimally. The foods we consume provide the building blocks for all bodily functions, affecting everything from energy levels to mental clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, if we consider children, teens, and pregnant women, proper nutrition is crucial for healthy growth, development, and reproduction. Nutrients like calcium, iron, and folic acid have a vital role in bone health and the development of the fetus.
        </p>
        <p>
            A balanced diet helps maintain high energy levels throughout the day. It also helps reduce the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain types of cancer. It helps regulate cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure, which are key factors in disease prevention.
        </p>
    
        <h4>General Tips:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Drink at least 1.5–2 liters of water per day.</li>
            <li>Include protein in each meal to support muscle growth and overall development.</li>
            <li>Avoid sugary foods, soda, and ultra-processed items.</li>
            <li>Adjust portion sizes based on physical activity and energy needs.</li>
        </ul>
